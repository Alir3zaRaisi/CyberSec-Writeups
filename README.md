# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Learning Journey

Welcome to my cybersecurity learning repository. I'm actively building skills in penetration testing, reverse engineering, and web security through hands-on labs and platforms.

## 🚩 TryHackMe Progress

I've completed over **25 rooms** on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/Al1r3zaRa1s1), focusing on:

- Networking and Linux fundamentals
- Buffer overflow and binary exploitation
- Web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, LFI, RFI)

---

## 🧪 Web Security Labs

I'm currently working through:
- [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security)
  - Practical labs on XSS, CSRF, LFI, SSRF, etc.
  - Focused on real-world attack techniques

## ⚙️ Reverse Engineering – crackmes.one

I'm actively studying reverse engineering by solving challenges from [crackmes.one](https://crackmes.one/). These labs help me develop skills in:

- Static and dynamic binary analysis
- Reverse engineering Windows and Linux binaries
- Exploiting logic flaws, obfuscation, and anti-debugging tricks

### 🔍 For each challenge, I include:
- 📝 Writeup: Step-by-step analysis of how I approached and solved the binary
- 🧩 Tools Used: (e.g., Ghidra, GDB, x64dbg, radare2)
- 🔓 Flag/Key: The final password, serial, or goal extracted from the binary
- 📎 Binary: The original `.exe` or `.elf` (if license allows)

## 🌐 SEED Labs – Network Security

I'm currently solving labs from the [SEED Labs](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/labs.html), focused on building foundational skills in network and system security.

### Topics I'm Working On:
- Packet sniffing and spoofing
- TCP/IP stack vulnerabilities
- ARP spoofing and DNS poisoning
- Attacks on TLS/HTTPS
