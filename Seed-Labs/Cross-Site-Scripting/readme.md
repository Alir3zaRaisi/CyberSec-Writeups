# XSS Worm Lab ‚Äì Elgg Exploitation

This project demonstrates several XSS-based attacks against the Elgg social networking platform, inspired by the Samy worm. It includes JavaScript payloads for:

- **Task 4:** Adding Samy as a friend via CSRF.
- **Task 5:** Modifying the victim‚Äôs profile field ("About Me").
- **Task 6:** Creating a self-propagating XSS worm using `<script src=...>`.
- **DOM-Based Worm:** Injecting the worm directly via DOM manipulation.
