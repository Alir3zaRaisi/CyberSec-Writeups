# ICMP Redirect & MitM Lab ‚Äì SEED Security Exercises

This project demonstrates two powerful network-level attacks using ICMP redirect and packet manipulation techniques in a Dockerized lab environment, inspired by the SEED Labs framework.

It includes:

- **Task 1:** ICMP Redirect Attack to reroute a victim's traffic through a malicious router.
- **Task 2:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) TCP payload manipulation attack using Scapy.
- **Analysis Section:** Answers to experimental questions about edge cases, packet direction, and filter strategy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Techniques Covered

- ICMP Redirect (Type 5, Code 0) spoofing with Scapy
- Network-wide redirection using forged gateway suggestions
- TCP sniff-and-spoof with payload rewriting
- MAC-based vs IP-based packet filtering
- Manipulating the Linux routing cache
- Disabling IP forwarding and using custom forwarding logic
